# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a program that add ands removes class objects from a vector with the ability to save or load the vector data into a separate .txt file. The class objects represent animals in a zoo and there are six possible animals that can be included in the data. These six animals are split up into mammals and oviparous. The problem that was solved was providing the ability to keep track of the animals in the zoo by saving the data to a .txt file.
