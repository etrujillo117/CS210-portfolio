# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a program that add ands removes class objects from a vector with the ability to save or load the vector data into a separate .txt file. The class objects represent animals in a zoo and there are six possible animals that can be included in the data. These six animals are split up into mammals and oviparous. The problem that was solved was providing the ability to keep track of the animals in the zoo by saving the data to a .txt file. 

# What did you do particularly well?
During this project, I feel that I did a good job at creating the objects and storing in a vector with initialization variables. I think I did a good job of integrating all the different components of the program cohesively so that it all works together well. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
This code could be enhanced by reducing the user input required. The project requirements had us get user input for animal type and subtype, but that could be already filled in based on the animal chosen. I could also use some work on the protected and private vaiables in all the functions. 


# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the most difficult part of this project was understanding the requirements because the instructions were vague. We were provided some Java code and a GenerateData function, but that function was not useful for any of the other functions we had to write. This confused me why there would be the Java function provided that was not even really used. Once I understood that we had to write our own C++ functions to save and load the data without referencing the Java function, the project became more clear. 


# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills that I learned from this project was how to work through a difficult project and figure things out on my own. I had problems along the way getting my classes to work with the vector and iostreams to txt files, but I feel accomplished being able to figure it out and make it work.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the program readable and adaptable by tying to provide clear comments and naming conventions throughout the code. I hope that my code would be easy to understand and modify by someone else.
